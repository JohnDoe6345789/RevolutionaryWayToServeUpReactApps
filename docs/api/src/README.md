# Source modules

This folder documents the React shell plus the curated data and theme that power the UI.

## Documents

- [`app.md`](app.md) – The `App` component that wires the hero, featured games, and footer.
- [`components.md`](components.md) – Hero, featured games grid, and footer strip breakdowns.
- [`data.md`](data.md) – Shared data arrays used by the hero and featured sections.
- [`theme.md`](theme.md) – Material UI theme configuration that keeps colors/typography consistent.

Each document links back to this index so the UI story remains easy to navigate.
