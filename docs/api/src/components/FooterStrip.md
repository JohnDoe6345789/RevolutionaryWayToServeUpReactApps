# Module: `src/components/FooterStrip.tsx`

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Shows legal links, support badges, and partner logos at the bottom of the splash page; keeps the experience grounded regardless of viewport height.
- **Layout:** The strip sticks to the viewport bottom and exposes telemetry hooks so accessibility reviewers can adjust contrast.

## Hooks

- `onExternalLink` — emitted when a footer tile opens a partner site, allowing telemetry or browser features to trace the click.
