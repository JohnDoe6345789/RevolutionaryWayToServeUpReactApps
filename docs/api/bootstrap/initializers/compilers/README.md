# bootstrap/initializers/compilers

This folder documents the compiler helpers that bootstrap uses to preprocess SCSS and TSX assets before rendering.

## Documents

- [`sass-compiler.md`](sass-compiler.md) – Details how SCSS files are compiled and injected before `bootstrap.js` renders the React tree.
- [`tsx-compiler.md`](tsx-compiler.md) – Describes the TSX compiler flow that supports hot reloading and local execution of entry components.
