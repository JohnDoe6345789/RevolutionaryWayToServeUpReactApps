# Testing surface

This area highlights the automated suites that keep the bootstrap/runtime solid for both Playwright and Jest.

## Documents

- [`e2e/README.md`](../e2e/README.md) – Outlines how `e2e/playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/run-e2e.js`, and `e2e/tests/page-load.spec.ts` keep the client bundle running through proxy hosts.
- [`test-tooling/tests/README.md`](../test-tooling/tests/README.md) – Describes every `test-tooling/tests/*.ts` entry (`App.test.tsx`, `bootstrap.test.ts`, `proxy-mode.test.ts`, etc.) that exercises React, loader, and proxy helper code via Jest.
